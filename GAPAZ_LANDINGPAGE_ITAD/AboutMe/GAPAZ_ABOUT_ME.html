			<blockquote><p >Playing <b>outdoors</b> is what I like when I was a childhood,
			   though I also play games before <sup>1</sup>. Playing agaw base,running back and forth in
			   order to win and even circling the blocks around the town in order to win unnoticed <sup>2</sup>.
			   I also play pogs which is very popular before, I have plenty of it before because I’m good at
			   it I guess <sup>3</sup>.It was also a source of income to me, I will sell it then play with
			   the buyer to get it back, pretty cunning right <sup>4</sup>.There is a technique called “kahig”
			   in pogs its when you strike it diagonally it is easier to make it go upside down <sup>5</sup>.
			   That’s why I got plenty of pogs before because I mastered that technique<sup>6</sup>.
			   It also has a type of game which is called banker you will gain much faster with this
			   one but it is based on luck that’s why its unreliable<sup>7</sup>.  Having just 5 pesos
			   was enough to make me happy I can play my favorite video games Yoshi and Mario, and play
			   Grand Theft Auto San Andreas <sup>8</sup>.It is also that time when I got the scar I have
			   on my nose<sup>9</sup> I fall while playing at a bunch of logs which has nails on it,
			   over the time it didn’t come off sad to say<sup>10</sup>. What I really like the most
			   before is boom sak, and bente uno<sup>11</sup>.I remember that time when I was playing
			   boom sak someone had to go fully naked in order to blend with the dark and it actually work,
			   how hilarious is that he was chasing the taya while naked<sup>12</sup>. I like bente uno
			   because it has many participants and its like aroyal rumble game, where you can change the
			   tide of the game yourself<sup>13</sup>. Running around the town was really great, one of the reason
			   why I was physically fit back then and I can also compete who run the fastest<sup>14</sup>.
			   There is a game before an adventure Pokémon that can be play online in web, I forgot the
			   name but I really like it, there’s so many legendary Pokémon that you can catch
			   it’s beautifully made<sup>15</sup>. As I was skilled in playing that I actually used it
			   as an excuse to play free in computer shop,the son of the owner always want my assistance
			   because he didn’t know what to do<sup>16</sup>. Little did he know that I was the one
			   on the chair and I was the one playing, I guess I’ll just call that clever<sup>17</sup>.
			   Counter Strike is actually pretty popular then,and also lasers<sup>18</sup>. The whole players
			   in the shop would compete in a death match in counter strike and compare scores to see
			   who will be the best<sup>19</sup>. Laser is actually one of my bad decision before, I always
			   challenged people to 1vs1 laser in the eye of who can withstand longer, I think its one of
			   the reason my eye got bad<sup>20</sup>.</p></blockquote>

		<h2 id="teenage"><em>Teenage Years</em></h2>
			<blockquote><p>This year was when I started my high school days,
			it’s also when I got circumcised exactly 13 years old<sup>1</sup>. When I was grade 7
			I’m still fond of studying so I always play lots and lots<sup>2</sup>. Here is when my
			first intrams where I participate began, I join in the chess but I suffered defeat as my
			opponent where trained since their childhood days<sup>3</sup>.Whenever there was no teacher,
			we would play monopoly in class to pass time, sometimes I bail out of school even when
			there is still classes going on<sup>4</sup>. In our school all students is assigned on days
			e.g Monday, to perform cleaning on school, and even with that I always disappear first to avoid
			it<sup>5</sup>. I Thought then, why would I clean I am in a private school got a janitor,
			that’s why I always leave but later I realize It was to teach us manners and how to do things
			at your house<sup>6</sup>.I think it was grade 9 when I act in a play as a water that waves,
			as I am bad at acting I always laugh at serious scenario<sup>7</sup>.My most favorite occasion
			back then was the birthday of a classmate, as I get along with almost all of them I am always invited,
			good it is to fill your belly that time<sup>8</sup>. That was the time when I was getting
			chubby as I was tasting the wonders of good food, that I don’t eat before<sup>9</sup>.
			It was grade 10 that I got addicted to DOTA(Defense Of The Ancients), I play a key role
			in games with big wager especially DOTA<sup>10</sup>.I would always join in tournament and
			they made me captain because I’m good<sup>11</sup>. There was even a time where guys from
			other town came and bet their money, was a pretty close game but we won, at that time when
			your hair is emo you are actually feared by players<sup>12</sup>. Then, the time came the
			I think it was called congressional meet, various parts of quezon province, came to our town,
			reina, islander, lucban, and many moreit was to compete in sports<sup>13</sup>. There are
			so many beautiful girls at that time that’s why I enjoy watching, but their skillsare really
			top tier in my eyes especially reina<sup>14</sup>. I forgot who won at that time but at least
			our town got some gold medal in some sports<sup>15</sup>.When I was in senior high our school
			got renovated, plenty of things came even tv’s put in every classroom<sup>16</sup>. It was used
			by us without the teachersconsent whenever we are bored we would watch movies and collaborate
			whether the teacher are coming<sup>17</sup>. Oh, we also did NCAE that time and I gota pretty
			good score though my predicted occasion is “undecided”, some of my classmates got priest and
			it was hilarious because its so far withwhat they want<sup>18</sup>. At grade 12 when they are
			giving grades I am actually became part of the honors list, I don’t know how because I always
			slack at school, but my exam got good score<sup>19</sup>. Then I graduated senior high and
			find where I could exam for colleges schools<sup>20</sup>. </p></blockquote>

		<h2 id="college"><em>College Years</em></h2>
			<blockquote><p>After I graduate from senior high, I go to different places to
			take college entrance exam, UP exam, SLSU exam, and UE exam<sup>1</sup>.The exam at UP were
			really hard it took me 6 hours, and I’m not even 80% done<sup>2</sup>. Well obviously since
			its hard, I failed since I didn’t do any review and I underestimated it<sup>3</sup>. Then I
			took up SLSU and UE exam, I passed both since its on moderate level not hard, I choose UE
			because I want to be far in my province and see new sights<sup>4</sup>. Then it was the first
			day of class in UE, well I actually got lost inside the campus so I had to ask a question to
			someone and so I did<sup>5</sup>. After that I found my room which is I think cs204 If I remember
			it right<sup>6</sup>. The first day is so hard for me because I don’t know anyone, and most
			of them know each other because they go to UE at senior high<sup>7</sup>. Then troy ask me
			if this room is cs204, that’s when I started to make friends, we talk little by little a week
			we got accustomed to each other and become friends<sup>8</sup>. They actually said that if
			I speak I always seemed mad, but that is just my accent here in Quezon my voice is a little
			bit loud and fast I think<sup>9</sup>.We would eat at the shop with the nanay that says
			“ate kuya kain na”, budget meal and not that bad in taste<sup>10</sup>. When there is a vacant
			time its time for the tusok tusok, which eliminate my remaining coins, its just beside
			gastam gate convenient and close<sup>11</sup>. What I will not forgot was the powhiri,
			it was so good I am  the front when the band starts rocking, jump jump jump yeahh!<sup>12</sup>
			Barry slipped when its so muddy when we are jumping in tune with the band, covering his
			entire clothes with mud.<sup>13</sup> After that there was the seagames fencing tournament
			at paco arena, and what did I just witness the players moves are too fast, there was one guy
			who fight eye to an eye with UE and it was a real exciting match.<sup>14</sup> but in the end
			UE won with the gold medal and even the girls team with Samantha won it.<sup>15</sup>
			There was also a time where UE experience some disaster I think its fire or earthquake,
			though I already got home I saw it live in fb and the students gather at the wide open
			space near gastam gate.<sup>16</sup> When we are almost done with first year, that’s when
			the covid spread enough in our country to cancel out every classes in school.<sup>17</sup>
			After that I immediately got home at march 8 when they officially announce that we passed
			and we don’t need to continue the finals.<sup>18</sup> That was when the online class began,
			I actually am not that sure If I want to attend classes like that but since I don’t want to
			be held back 1 year, I thought its good it’s a new experience. <sup>19</sup> I past first
			semester thankfully and even got scholar, then I started second semester and here
			I am now.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
