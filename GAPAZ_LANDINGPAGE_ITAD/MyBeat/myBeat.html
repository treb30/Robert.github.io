	<h2>Comethru by Jeremy Zucker</h2>
	<blockquote><p>“comethru” is a song Jeremy Zucker wrote while spending days secluded in his parents’
	basement during the summer of 2018. Accordingly during this period he suffered from
	loneliness. As such this track is based on his desire for someone to ‘come through’
	and spend some time with him. And he doesn’t necessarily mean a girlfriend but any
	friend in general. And he is not requesting anything from this person except that they
	arrive and keep him company.</p></blockquote>

	<h2>Deathbed by Powfu</h2>
	<blockquote><p>Powfu’s ‘Death Bed’ is a song that appears as if it is being sung from
	the viewpoint of a very young man who is passing away. In this concisely formulated song, 
	he is basically near to his demise. The individual that the singer is addressing could 
	easily be his love interest. Let’s learn the meaning behind the lyrics of the song ‘Death 
	Bed (coffee for your head)’ by Powfu.

	circumstances, but mainly in times of trouble. “One Call Away” hints at someone who 
	falls deeply in love and sees no problem in caring for a partner in the best way 
	possible. This person is always available as long as his/her partner calls on him. 
	“One Call Away” expresses the feelings of someone who is deeply in love and cares 
	for his/her lover at all times.

	<h2>Shape of You by Ed Sheeran</h2>
	<blockquote><p>"Shape of You" is unique mostly because of the island style beat and 
	instrumentation. The lyrics seem unique for Ed Sheeran songs. They're largely about sex 
	and falling in love with a woman's body whereas many of his songs seem a bit sadder and 
	less sugary. But that's all right. We're here to explain, not to judge "Shape of You," 
	and the light-heartedness of this song's meaning can be a good thing anyway.

	<h2>Tonight by FM static</h2>
	<blockquote><p>It was really a sad story. The composer was engaged with his long time 
	girlfriend. As they depart for work, his girlfriend died and was one of the victims of 
	the 9/11 incident at Twin Towers. He was so deeply heart broken and devastated. Thus, 
	he composed that song in honor of his girlfriend.

	<h2>Fall for you by Secondhand Serenade</h2>
	<blockquote><p>The song is really about a relationship slowly deteriorating to a point 
	where it seems that there is absolutely no way to save it. It takes you through the 
	various stages of the relationship up until the point where it seems useless to go on 
	and then something happens. You see a glimpse of what your life would be like without 
	that person and you realize how much you need them. I really love this song because its 
	very realistic. It definitely has it's dark side. I tend to write like that a lot. 
	If I sugarcoat my songs then I'm not really writing the truth. There is a lot of pain 
	in life, and you have to experience it in order to enjoy the few moments that life feels 
	perfect. It's totally worth it in my opinion."

	<h2>You and Me by Lifehouse</h2>
	<blockquote><p>This is a rather giddy love song about being so thoroughly smitten with a 
	girl that time and space seem irrelevant. Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade wrote it for 
	his girlfriend, Braeden, whom he married in 2001. He proposed to her using an early 
	version of the song he had on cassette; after the song was finally released in 2005, 
	it became a very popular wedding song. "It was this special song to me that was laying 
	around," Wade told Billboard. "Literally, the first version was on a cassette tape - so 
	'80s. It was kind of my wedding song. It was so personal, so it was very interesting 
	to me that it became this wedding anthem."
